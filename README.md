# Simple-Calculator
A project I worked on for helping me learn JS and also lead to me learning CSS which is also great! (Calculator is crappy though)

# Updates
I doubt anyone wants updates on this project as it will never be used again but I may update it along with new features if I feel like it or don't have another project to work on

# Features
- Basic +, -, /, *.
- Get the percent of a number
